**Hello!** As many of you already know, we are working very hard to release the first Early Access version of our beloved project, **Mind of War**.
We also wanted to work on a new website that will serve as a reference point to get to know each other and share with you many aspects about our studio, news, status updates on our projects (current and future), and keep a closer contact with our community.

Here are some screenshots that will be soon available on the Steam shop as an exclusive preview for you.

So we take this opportunity to ask for a little more patience with the release of the game. We share your excitement to see it all up and running and in your hands, and we hope to be able to give you news very soon. We will soon release a new trailer, with the essence of the previous one but showing some of the new content, the new interface and some of the effects we have been working on, with the conviction that you will love them.
