**The first Early Access version of Mind of War has been released!**
_(Yes, and we didn't tell you about it here, we're really sorry)_

But there's one more piece of news! We're participating in the **Steam RPG Festival** - take advantage of the launch offer and get Mind of War at a special price.

And very soon we'll have an update with two new very challenging confrontations, balancing, some new skills, polished animations and sound effects, and some other stuff we're sure we're forgetting!
